# Password cracker project  

This project contains 2 approaches to crack passwords using C and CUDA.  

- CPU-password-cracker folder uses CPU and multithreaded programming to crack passwords.  

- GPU-password-cracker folder uses uses GPU to crack passwords using CUDA API. 

## Method:  
Each password has a unique hashcode generated by MD5 algorithm. Given a hashcode, the program will try to guess the password using brute force every possible string. In this project, the password length is limited to 6 characters.
